## 🛠️ Getting Started (It's Easier Than You Think!)

### Prerequisites

- ✅ **VS Code 1.120+** (required)
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot Individual** subscription (Free or Paid Individual plans work).
  - ⚠️ **Important**: GitHub Copilot Business (Organization) and Enterprise plans are **not currently supported** due to VS Code API limitations. For technical details, see the [VS Code Language Model API documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/language-model-chat-provider) and the list of [supported individual plans](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/individual-plans).
- 🌐 A **LiteLLM proxy** running somewhere (locally or in the cloud)
- 🔑 Your **Base URL** and **API Key**

> **New to LiteLLM?** Check out [their documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai) to learn how to set up a proxy that can route to any model provider.

### Installation & Setup (60 seconds)

1. **Install** the "LiteLLM Connector for Copilot" extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open** Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. **Run** **LiteLLM: Manage Configuration**
4. **Add** one or more backends (name, Base URL, and API key)
5. **Open** Copilot Chat and pick a model from your configured backend/provider group label (for example, `Cloud`, `Local`, `CoolProvider`)
6. **Start chatting!** 🎉

> **Configuration path**: This extension uses VS Code's **Language Models provider-group** flow (VS Code 1.120+) for full model-picker/category behavior. All backend connection details are configured through VS Code's native Language Models settings — no workspace settings required.

> **Multi-Backend Power**: Configure multiple LiteLLM provider groups (for example local + cloud + internal). Models are namespaced and grouped by backend so it is clear which provider each model comes from.

> **Provider grouping remains intact**: each backend name is preserved as its provider/group label, so models stay clearly identifiable in the Language Models view and picker.

> **⚠️ 2.0.0 temporary limitation**: Unless manually configured, **Git Commit Message Generation** and **Inline Completions** are currently inoperative in this release. We are actively fixing modern-config parity for both paths.
> Manual setup: use **LiteLLM: Select Commit Message Model** and **LiteLLM: Select Inline Completion Model** (plus inline completion settings) if you need these features immediately.

That's it! Your models from the LiteLLM proxy will automatically appear in the model picker.

## 💡 What Makes This Special?

This isn't just another AI connector—it's built with care and designed for real-world use:

### 🌍 **Any Model, Any Provider**
Access hundreds of models through your LiteLLM proxy: GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro, Llama 3, DeepSeek, local models, and custom fine-tunes. All in one place.

### ⛓️ **Multi-Backend Aggregation**
Connect to multiple LiteLLM instances at once. Mix and match local, cloud, and team proxies seamlessly. Models from different backends are clearly labeled and ready for use.

### 🌊 **Smooth Streaming Experience**
Real-time, streaming responses just like native Copilot models. No waiting for complete responses—watch as the AI thinks and types.

### 🛠️ **Full Tool Calling Support**
Models can use tools and functions to interact with your workspace. Perfect for code analysis, git operations, and complex workflows.

### 👁️ **Vision Capabilities**
Use image-capable models to analyze screenshots, diagrams, and code directly in chat. Upload images and get insights.

### 🧠 **Rich Response Parts**
The chat provider emits structured response parts to VS Code — text, thinking/reasoning, data, and tool-call parts — using the VS Code 1.120 Language Model APIs. Reasoning models that produce thinking output render correctly in the chat UI.

### 🧠 **Smart, Automatic Compatibility**
The extension automatically handles provider-specific quirks:
- Strips unsupported parameters (like `temperature` for O1 models)
- Retries with cleaned payloads when models reject flags
- Normalizes tool call IDs for strict providers
- No manual parameter tuning needed

### 📊 **Token Awareness**
See real-time token usage with context window indicators (e.g., "↑128K in / ↓16K out"). Helps you stay within limits and understand costs.

### ✍️ **Git Commit Generation**
Generate structured, conventional commit messages from your staged changes.
⚠️ In `2.0.0`, this currently requires manual model configuration to operate reliably.

### 🧼 **Smart Sanitization**
Automatically strips Markdown code blocks from generated commit messages for a clean SCM experience.

### 🔍 **Built-in Diagnostics**
Run `LiteLLM: Check Connection` anytime to verify your proxy configuration. Troubleshooting made easy.

### ⏱️ **Reliable Timeout Handling**
Optional inactivity watchdog prevents stuck streams. Configurable timeout keeps your workflow smooth.

### 🚫🧠 **Cache Control**
Send `no-cache` headers to bypass LiteLLM caching when you need fresh responses. Provider-aware behavior ensures compatibility.

### 🔐 **Secure by Design**
Your API keys and URLs are stored safely in VS Code's encrypted `SecretStorage`. No plaintext secrets.

### 🧩 **Model Override System**
Fine-grained control over reasoning capabilities for specific models. The override system lets you customize how models are presented to VS Code:

- **`litellm-connector.modelOverrides`** — Define regex-based rules to control reasoning effort levels, tags, and supported parameters for matching models.
- **`litellm-connector.enableModelOverrides`** — Master toggle (default: `true`). Set to `false` to disable all override rules and rely solely on LiteLLM's `/model/info` auto-discovery. Useful when proxy-reported capabilities are accurate and overrides are no longer needed.

When enabled, user-defined overrides take precedence over bundled defaults. Both are merged with auto-discovered capabilities from the LiteLLM proxy.

### ⌨️ **Optional Inline Completions**
Enable LiteLLM-powered inline completions as an alternative to Copilot's default.
⚠️ In `2.0.0`, this currently requires manual configuration to operate reliably.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### "Models aren't showing up after configuration"

1. Run **`LiteLLM: Check Connection`** to verify your Base URL and API key
2. Ensure your LiteLLM proxy is running and accessible
3. Wait briefly after config edits; model discovery auto-refreshes after configuration changes
4. Try **`LiteLLM: Reload Models`** to force a refresh
5. If still stuck, use **`LiteLLM: Reset All Configuration`** and start fresh

### "Connection fails / timeout errors"

- Check that your LiteLLM proxy is running and the Base URL is correct
- Verify network connectivity (firewall, VPN, proxy settings)
- If using a remote proxy, ensure CORS is configured appropriately
- Check the proxy logs for incoming requests

### "Reinstalling didn't fix the problem"

VS Code stores credentials in encrypted `SecretStorage`. Reinstalling doesn't clear this. Use **`LiteLLM: Reset All Configuration`** instead.

### "I get 'Quota Exceeded' errors"

The extension automatically detects quota errors and can redact tools to recover. If this happens frequently:
- Check your LiteLLM proxy's rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan or adding more API keys
- The `disableQuotaToolRedaction` setting can control this behavior

### "Tool calls are failing"

Some models have strict tool-call validation. The extension normalizes tool call IDs automatically, but if you encounter issues:
- Verify your LiteLLM proxy supports the model's tool-calling format
- Check proxy logs for rejected requests
- Try a different model variant
